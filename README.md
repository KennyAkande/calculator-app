# Simple Calculator Web App

This is a simple calculator web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. It's a clean and interactive web-based calculator designed with a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Clear (`C`) and backspace (`⌫`) functionality
- Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile views
- Display screen that shows the input and result

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the page
- **CSS**: For styling the app and making it responsive
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: For adding interactivity and handling logic like button clicks and calculations

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/KennyAkande/calculator-app

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
You can now open the `index.html` file in any modern browser to start using the calculator app.

## How It Works
- When you click any of the number or operator buttons, it adds the corresponding value to the input string.
- The `=` button evaluates the expression using `eval()` (JavaScript function) and displays the result.
- The `C` button clears the input, and the `⌫` button removes the last character.
